# Database Intelligence Collector - Working Components

## Successfully Built and Tested Configuration

### Core Components
- **OTLP Receiver**: Accepting metrics and logs on ports 4317 (gRPC) and 4318 (HTTP)
- **Batch Processor**: Batching telemetry data with 5s timeout
- **Memory Limiter Processor**: Limiting memory usage to 512MB with 128MB spike allowance

### Custom Processors (6 Working)

#### Metrics Pipeline Processors
1. **costcontrol**: Tracks ingestion costs and enforces budget limits
   - Supports: Traces, Metrics, Logs
   - Reports cost estimates and budget utilization
   
2. **nrerrormonitor**: Monitors for New Relic integration errors
   - Supports: Metrics only
   - Tracks error patterns and rates
   
3. **querycorrelator**: Correlates queries with table and database statistics
   - Supports: Metrics only
   - Configurable retention period and cleanup interval
   - Enables table and database correlation

#### Logs Pipeline Processors
1. **circuit_breaker**: Implements circuit breaker pattern for resilience
   - Supports: Logs only
   - Configurable failure/success thresholds
   - Adaptive timeout support
   
2. **planattributeextractor**: Extracts query plan attributes
   - Supports: Logs only
   - Requires pre-collected plan data
   - Recommends pg_stat_statements or pg_querylens
   
3. **verification**: Verifies log integrity and checksums
   - Supports: Logs only
   - Performs data validation

### Custom Exporter
- **NRI (New Relic Infrastructure)**: Exports to New Relic Infrastructure format
  - Supports both metrics and logs
  - Multiple output modes: stdout, file, HTTP
  - Entity mapping and metric/event transformation rules

### Binary Details
- **Size**: ~40MB
- **Name**: otelcol-working
- **Version**: 2.0.0

### Test Configuration
The collector has been successfully tested with `test-processors-proper.yaml` which includes:
- All 6 custom processors in appropriate pipelines
- NRI exporter for both metrics and logs
- Debug exporter for troubleshooting

### Components Pending Fix
1. **adaptivesampler processor**: Duplicate type definitions
2. **ASH receiver**: Scraper API compatibility issues  
3. **kernelmetrics receiver**: Configuration struct issues
4. **Database-specific receivers**: PostgreSQL, MySQL receivers need updates

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining component issues
2. Add contrib components for database monitoring
3. Create comprehensive E2E test suite
4. Build production-ready distribution with all components
