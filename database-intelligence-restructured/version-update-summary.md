# Version Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the entire Database Intelligence codebase to align with OpenTelemetry Collector v1.35.0 + v0.129.0 version pattern.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Workspace Version
- Updated go.work from `go 1.24.3` to `go 1.23.0`
- This resolved workspace compatibility issues

### 2. Module Path Alignment
- Removed `-restructured` suffix from all module paths
- Updated from `github.com/database-intelligence-restructured/` to `github.com/database-intelligence/`
- Fixed all import statements and replace directives

### 3. Version Pattern Alignment
Successfully updated all modules to follow the core module pattern:
- Base packages: v1.35.0 (component, pdata, consumer, etc.)
- Implementation packages: v0.129.0 (otelcol, exporters, processors, etc.)
- Scraper packages: v0.129.0 (scraper, scraperhelper)

### 4. Fixed Import Path Changes
- Updated scraperhelper imports from `receiver/scraperhelper` to `scraper/scraperhelper`
- Updated scrapererror imports from `receiver/scrapererror` to `scraper/scrapererror`

### 5. Removed Problematic Dependencies
