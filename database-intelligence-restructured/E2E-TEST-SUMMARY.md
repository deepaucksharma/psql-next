# E2E Testing Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed PostgreSQL Container Issues ✓
- Fixed PostgreSQL init script syntax error (`IF NOT EXISTS` not supported for `CREATE DATABASE`)
- Updated init script to properly create testdb database
- Verified both PostgreSQL and MySQL containers start successfully

### 2. Database Connectivity Verified ✓
- PostgreSQL: Successfully connected and created test tables
- MySQL: Successfully connected and created test tables
- Both databases healthy and responding to queries

### 3. Project Structure Validation ✓
**Components Found:**
- **Processors (7/7):** All custom processors present
  - adaptivesampler
  - circuitbreaker
  - costcontrol
  - nrerrormonitor
  - planattributeextractor
  - querycorrelator
  - verification

- **Receivers (3/3):** All custom receivers present
  - ash
  - enhancedsql
  - kernelmetrics

- **Go Modules:** 22 modules in workspace
- **Deployment Files:** Docker Compose and Kubernetes files present

### 4. E2E Test Scripts Created ✓
- `run-simple-e2e-test.sh` - Basic database connectivity test
- `run-comprehensive-e2e-test.sh` - Full pipeline test with metrics
- `validate-e2e-structure.sh` - Project structure validation

## Key Findings

### Working Components
1. Database containers start and initialize correctly
2. All custom processors and receivers are present
3. Go workspace properly configured with 22 modules
4. Basic deployment infrastructure in place

### Missing Components
1. Configuration files in `config/` directory (0/5 found)
2. Docker build file (`deployments/docker/Dockerfile`)
3. Helm chart files

### OpenTelemetry Version Issues
- Encountered version conflicts between v0.110.0 and v1.16.0
- Some modules require different versions of confmap components
- Builder tool had issues with module resolution

## Next Steps

1. **Restore Missing Configurations**
   - Check backups for config files
   - Create minimal working configurations

2. **Build Working Collector**
   - Use standard OpenTelemetry components first
   - Gradually add custom processors/receivers

3. **Complete Integration Testing**
   - Test each processor individually
   - Validate end-to-end data flow

## Test Results

- **Database Connectivity:** ✓ Both databases working
- **Project Structure:** 68% complete (15/22 checks passed)
- **Custom Components:** ✓ All present
- **E2E Pipeline:** Partial (needs working collector binary)

The refactoring successfully consolidated the project structure while preserving all custom components. The main remaining work is restoring configuration files and building a working collector binary.
