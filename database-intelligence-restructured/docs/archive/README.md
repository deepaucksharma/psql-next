# Archived Documentation

This directory contains the previous documentation structure that has been consolidated and streamlined.

## What Was Archived

### Previous Structure (108 files → 6 files)

The documentation was restructured from a complex multi-directory structure to a simple, focused approach:

**Old Structure**:
- `01-quick-start/` - Multiple quick start guides
- `02-e2e-testing/` - Extensive E2E testing documentation
- `03-ohi-migration/` - OHI migration guides
- `04-implementation/` - Implementation analysis
- `05-maintenance/` - Maintenance guides
- `06-security/` - Security documentation
- `architecture/` - Detailed architecture docs
- `architecture-review/` - Phase-based review docs
- `operations/` - Operations guides
- `project-status/` - Multiple status reports

**New Simplified Structure**:
- `README.md` - Navigation hub
- `OVERVIEW.md` - Project overview and architecture
- `QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute setup guide
- `CONFIGURATION.md` - Complete configuration reference
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Production deployment guide
- `TESTING.md` - Testing strategy and execution
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Issue resolution guide

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Implementation Reality Check
- Removed documentation for non-integrated custom components
- Clearly marked what's production-ready vs. development
- Aligned documentation with actual working configurations

### 2. User-Focused Organization
- Organized by user journey instead of internal project phases
- Eliminated redundant information across multiple files
- Focused on actionable content

### 3. Reduced Maintenance Burden
- Single source of truth for each topic
- Eliminated duplicated information
- Focused on essential information only

## Migration Guide

If you need information from the archived documentation:

1. **Quick Start**: Use new `QUICK_START.md` instead of `01-quick-start/`
2. **Architecture**: See `OVERVIEW.md` instead of `architecture/`
3. **Configuration**: Use `CONFIGURATION.md` instead of scattered config docs
4. **Deployment**: Use `DEPLOYMENT.md` instead of `operations/deployment.md`
5. **Testing**: Use `TESTING.md` instead of `02-e2e-testing/`
6. **Issues**: Use `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` instead of multiple troubleshooting docs

## What's Still Relevant

Some archived content may still be useful for historical context:

- **Project Status Reports**: Track the evolution of the project
- **Architecture Reviews**: Detailed technical analysis
- **Implementation Analysis**: Understanding design decisions
- **E2E Testing Reports**: Comprehensive test results

## Accessing Archived Content

All archived content remains available in this directory for reference, but the new streamlined documentation should be your primary resource.
