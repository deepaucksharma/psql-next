# Execute removal
./scripts/maintenance/cleanup-archives.sh --execute
```

### 2. Clean Up Old Documentation
```bash
# Remove duplicate MD files in root
rm -f CLAUDE.md CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md CODEBASE_*.md
rm -f DIVERGENCE_*.md E2E_*.md IMPLEMENTATION_*.md
rm -f MULTI_DATABASE_*.md STREAMLINING_*.md

# Keep only essential reports
# Keep: README.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, FINAL_PROJECT_REPORT.md
```

### 3. Remove MVP Project (Optional)
```bash
# If no longer needed, archive the entire MVP directory
tar -czf database-intelligence-mvp-archive.tar.gz ../database-intelligence-mvp/
# Then remove: rm -rf ../database-intelligence-mvp/
```

### 4. Git Cleanup
```bash
# Add all changes
git add -A

# Commit the consolidation
git commit -m "feat: Major consolidation and cleanup

- Reduced scripts from 168 to 31 (organized by function)
- Consolidated configs from 38 to 9
- Created unified testing framework
- Standardized documentation structure
- Added comprehensive validation tools
- Removed 232MB of archive files
- Created clear project structure with indexes"

# Tag this version
git tag -a v2.0-consolidated -m "Consolidated and cleaned version"
```

### 5. Update CI/CD
- Update any CI/CD pipelines to use new script locations
- Update deployment scripts to reference new structure
- Update documentation links in external systems

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Validation

Run these commands to ensure everything works:

```bash
# 1. Validate structure
./scripts/validate-all.sh

# 2. Test a database config
./scripts/testing/test-database-config.sh postgresql

# 3. Check documentation
ls docs/guides/*.md
ls docs/reference/*.md

# 4. Verify key scripts
ls scripts/*/*.sh | wc -l  # Should show ~31
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

âœ… **Code Reduction**: 76% fewer scripts
âœ… **Config Simplification**: 74% fewer configs  
âœ… **Documentation**: Single source of truth
âœ… **Testing**: One command to run all tests
âœ… **Maintenance**: Clear structure for updates

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Share the new structure with team
2. Update any external documentation
3. Train team on new script locations
4. Set up regular maintenance schedule
5. Monitor for any issues during transition
