# Phase 1.1: Module Consolidation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully consolidated component modules from 25 to 14 modules by creating a unified components module.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified Components Module
- Created `components/go.mod` with OpenTelemetry v0.92.0
- All components now share the same dependencies
- No more version conflicts between components

### 2. Migrated All Components
```
components/
├── go.mod
├── processors/
│   ├── adaptivesampler/
│   ├── circuitbreaker/
│   ├── costcontrol/
│   ├── nrerrormonitor/
│   ├── planattributeextractor/
│   ├── querycorrelator/
│   └── verification/
├── receivers/
│   ├── ash/
│   ├── enhancedsql/
│   └── kernelmetrics/
├── exporters/
│   └── nri/
└── extensions/
    └── healthcheck/
```

### 3. Updated Import Paths
- Changed from: `github.com/database-intelligence/processors/*`
- Changed to: `github.com/deepaksharma/db-otel/components/processors/*`
- Updated 9 files with new import paths

### 4. Simplified go.work
```go
use (
    ./components
    ./distributions/production
    ./internal/database
)
```

## Results
- **Before**: 25 go.mod files
- **After**: 14 go.mod files (44% reduction)
- **Component modules**: Reduced from 12 to 1
- **Version conflicts**: Eliminated

## Next Steps
- Phase 1.2: Fix memory leaks in components
- Phase 1.3: Further consolidate remaining modules (target: 3-4 total)
