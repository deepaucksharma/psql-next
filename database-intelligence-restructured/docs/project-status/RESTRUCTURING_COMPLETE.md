# Database Intelligence Restructuring Complete

## Summary

The database-intelligence-mvp project has been successfully restructured into a modular Go workspace architecture at:
`/Users/deepaksharma/syc/db-otel/database-intelligence-restructured/`

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Modular Structure
- **605 files** migrated and organized
- Each component is now a separate Go module
- Clean separation of concerns with Go workspace

### 2. Directory Organization
```
database-intelligence-restructured/
├── core/                    # Core collector implementation
├── processors/              # 7 custom processors (each with own go.mod)
│   ├── adaptivesampler/
│   ├── circuitbreaker/
│   ├── costcontrol/
│   ├── nrerrormonitor/
│   ├── planattributeextractor/
│   ├── querycorrelator/
│   └── verification/
├── receivers/               # 3 custom receivers (each with own go.mod)
│   ├── ash/
│   ├── enhancedsql/
│   └── kernelmetrics/
├── exporters/               # Custom exporters

├── extensions/              # Extensions
│   ├── healthcheck/

├── common/                  # Shared libraries
├── distributions/           # Pre-built distributions
│   ├── minimal/
│   ├── standard/
│   └── enterprise/
├── configs/                 # Organized configurations
├── deployments/            # Docker, K8s, Helm charts
├── tests/                  # All test suites
└── tools/                  # Scripts and CI/CD

### 3. Import Path Updates
All imports updated from:
- `github.com/database-intelligence-mvp` → `github.com/database-intelligence`

### 4. Scripts Organized
- Build scripts → `tools/scripts/build/`
- Test scripts → `tools/scripts/test/`
- Deploy scripts → `tools/scripts/deploy/`
- Maintenance scripts → `tools/scripts/maintenance/`

### 5. Documentation Organized
- Architecture docs → `docs/architecture/`
- Deployment guides → `docs/deployment/`
- Development docs → `docs/development/`
- Previous analysis → `docs/archive/analysis/`

## Known Issues to Fix

1. **Module Dependencies**: Some modules need their dependencies updated. Run:
   ```bash
   # For each module directory
   cd [module-dir]
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Version Alignment**: Some OpenTelemetry dependencies have version mismatches that need resolution.

3. **Registry Files**: The registry.go files in processors/, receivers/, etc. need to be updated to properly export all components.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Update all module dependencies
   for mod in $(find . -name "go.mod" -type f | grep -v "go.work"); do
     dir=$(dirname $mod)
     echo "Updating $dir"
     (cd $dir && go mod tidy)
   done
   ```

2. **Build Distributions**:
   ```bash
   # After fixing dependencies
   make build-minimal
   make build-standard
   make build-enterprise
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   make test-all
   ```

4. **Update CI/CD**:
   - Update GitHub Actions workflows for new structure
   - Update build scripts for new paths
   - Update deployment configurations

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Modularity**: Each component can be versioned and maintained independently
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to create custom distributions with specific components
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Scalability**: New components can be added without affecting others
5. **Testing**: Each module can be tested in isolation
