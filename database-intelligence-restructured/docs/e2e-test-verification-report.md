# E2E Test Verification Report

## Summary
During E2E test verification, discovered that the module consolidation in Phase 1.1 was incomplete. The production distribution still references individual component modules instead of the consolidated components module.

## Issues Found

### 1. Module References
The production distribution's go.mod file still contains:
- Individual references to each component (e.g., `github.com/deepaksharma/db-otel/components/processors/adaptivesampler`)
- Replace directives pointing to the old individual module structure
- This defeats the purpose of module consolidation

### 2. Build Errors
```
exporters/nri/exporter.go:10:2: reading ../exporters/nri/go.mod: no such file or directory
```
The build fails because individual go.mod files were removed during consolidation, but the replace directives still expect them.

## Required Fixes

### Option 1: Complete the Consolidation (Recommended)
Update production/go.mod to:
1. Reference the single consolidated components module
2. Remove all individual component references
3. Update imports in production code

### Option 2: Revert to Individual Modules
1. Restore individual go.mod files for each component
2. Keep the current production/go.mod structure
3. Lose the benefits of consolidation

## Recommendation
Complete the consolidation by updating the production distribution to use the single components module. This will:
- Simplify dependency management
- Ensure consistent versions
- Enable successful builds and tests

## Next Steps
1. Update production/go.mod to reference `github.com/deepaksharma/db-otel/components`
2. Update imports in production code
3. Remove individual component replace directives
4. Run E2E tests to verify the fix
