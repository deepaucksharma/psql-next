   - Requirements: Pre-collected plan data

4. **Verification**
   - Stability: Beta (Logs)
   - Features: Data integrity and checksum verification

#### Metrics Pipeline Processors
1. **NRErrorMonitor**
   - Stability: Beta (Metrics)
   - Features: Monitors New Relic integration errors

2. **QueryCorrelator**
   - Stability: Beta (Metrics)
   - Features: Correlates queries with table/database statistics

#### Multi-Pipeline Processor
1. **CostControl**
   - Stability: Beta (Traces, Metrics, Logs)
   - Features: Ingestion cost tracking and budget enforcement
   - Reports: Real-time cost estimates and projections

### Custom Exporter (1)

1. **NRI (New Relic Infrastructure)**
   - Stability: Beta (Metrics, Logs)
   - Features:
     - Multiple output modes (stdout, file, HTTP)
     - Entity mapping and transformation
     - Metric and event rule processing

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, ash, kernelmetrics]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch, costcontrol, nrerrormonitor, querycorrelator]
      exporters: [debug, nri]
      
    logs:

```

### Next Steps
1. Add OpenTelemetry Contrib receivers (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. Implement eBPF programs for kernelmetrics
3. Complete ASH database connection implementation
4. Create comprehensive E2E test suite
5. Add production configuration templates
