# E2E Validation Summary

## Successfully Completed

1. **Database Infrastructure**: ✅
   - PostgreSQL and MySQL containers are running and healthy
   - Init scripts working correctly
   - Databases accessible and properly configured

2. **Module Structure**: ✅
   - All modules updated to consistent naming (`github.com/database-intelligence/`)
   - Version alignment achieved (v1.35.0 + v0.129.0 pattern)
   - go.work fixed to use Go 1.23

3. **Minimal Production Collector**: ✅
   - Successfully built minimal collector with core components only
   - Binary size: ~100MB (check exact size)
   - Components included:
     - Receivers: OTLP (gRPC:4317, HTTP:4318)
     - Processors: batch, memory_limiter
     - Exporters: debug, otlp
   - Collector starts, validates configs, and runs successfully

## Current Status

The minimal collector (`otelcol-minimal`) is fully functional and can be used as a base. It includes:
- Proper configuration provider support (file, env, yaml, http/https)
- All core OpenTelemetry components
- Clean startup and shutdown
- Configuration validation

## Remaining Work

### Custom Components Need Fixes:
1. **Processors** (7 total) - Compilation errors in:
   - adaptivesampler - type conflicts, missing methods
   - Others have minor issues

2. **Receivers** (3 total) - Need API updates for:
   - ash - scraper API changes
   - enhancedsql - missing internal/database module  
   - kernelmetrics - config struct issues

3. **Exporters** (1 total):
   - nri - config syntax errors from incomplete rate limiter removal

4. **Common modules**:
   - featuredetector - missing DatabaseVersion field

## How to Run the Minimal Collector

```bash
cd distributions/production

# Validate configuration
./otelcol-minimal validate --config=test-minimal.yaml

# Run the collector
./otelcol-minimal --config=test-minimal.yaml

# Or use existing configs
./otelcol-minimal --config=../../config/collector-simple.yaml
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Custom Components** (one by one):
   - Start with simpler components (e.g., processors without external dependencies)
   - Fix compilation errors systematically
   - Add them back to production distribution incrementally

2. **Add Database Monitoring**:
   - Once custom components work, add contrib receivers for PostgreSQL/MySQL
   - Test with actual database connections

3. **Create Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Unit tests for custom components
   - Integration tests with databases
   - E2E test suite

## Key Learnings

1. OpenTelemetry versioning is complex - different components use different version schemes
2. Building incrementally (minimal first, then add components) is more effective
3. Module path consistency is critical for Go workspaces
4. Rate limiter removal needs to be done carefully to avoid syntax errors

The foundation is solid - we have a working collector that can be extended with custom components once they're fixed.
