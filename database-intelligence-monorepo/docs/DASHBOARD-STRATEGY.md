SELECT average(mysql_global_status_max_connections) as 'Max Connections',
       average(mysql_global_status_threads_connected) as 'Active Connections',
       (average(mysql_global_status_threads_connected) / average(mysql_global_status_max_connections)) * 100 as 'Connection Utilization %'

```

## üîß **Dashboard Implementation**

### **Automated Dashboard Deployment**

```bash
# Deploy all dashboards
./shared/newrelic/scripts/deploy-dashboards.sh

# Deploy specific dashboard
./shared/newrelic/scripts/deploy-dashboard.sh --name "database-intelligence-executive"

# Validate dashboard deployment
./shared/newrelic/scripts/validate-dashboards.sh
```

### **Dashboard Configuration Standards**

Each dashboard follows these standards:
- **Time Range**: Default to 1 hour, with quick selectors for 6h, 24h, 7d
- **Auto-refresh**: 30 seconds for operational dashboards, 5 minutes for executive
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Red for critical, yellow for warning, green for healthy
- **Tooltip Documentation**: Every widget includes helpful tooltips

### **Custom Attributes for Enhanced Filtering**

All metrics include standardized attributes:
```yaml
Standard Attributes:
- environment: production|staging|development
- cluster.name: database-intelligence-cluster
- module: core-metrics|sql-intelligence|wait-profiler|etc
- mysql.endpoint: MySQL server identifier
- business_criticality: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW
- performance_impact: critical|high|medium|low
```

## üìä **NRQL Query Patterns**

### **Performance Analysis Patterns**

```nrql
-- Top Slow Queries by Business Impact
SELECT latest(DIGEST_TEXT) as 'Query',
       average(mysql_query_duration_milliseconds) as 'Avg Duration (ms)',
       sum(business_impact_score) as 'Business Impact Score',
       count(*) as 'Executions'
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName = 'mysql_query_duration_milliseconds'
  AND business_impact_score > 5
FACET DIGEST
ORDER BY sum(business_impact_score) DESC
LIMIT 20
SINCE 6 hours ago
```

```nrql
-- Wait Event Trending
SELECT average(mysql_wait_time_ms)
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName = 'mysql.wait.time_ms'
  AND wait_category IN ('io', 'lock', 'mutex')
FACET wait_category
TIMESERIES 5 minutes
SINCE 2 hours ago
```

```nrql
-- Resource Utilization Correlation
SELECT average(host_cpu_utilization) as 'CPU %',
       average(host_memory_utilization) as 'Memory %',
       average(mysql_global_status_threads_running) as 'Active Threads'
FROM Metric 
WHERE instrumentation.name IN ('mysql-core-metrics', 'mysql-resource-monitor')
TIMESERIES AUTO
SINCE 4 hours ago
```

### **Anomaly Detection Patterns**

```nrql
-- Statistical Anomalies
SELECT count(*) as 'Anomaly Count'
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName LIKE 'anomaly_score_%'
  AND is_anomaly = true
FACET anomaly_type, severity
SINCE 1 hour ago
```

```nrql
-- Performance Regression Detection
SELECT average(mysql_query_duration_milliseconds) as 'Current Performance',
       average(mysql_query_duration_milliseconds) as 'Baseline Performance'
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName = 'mysql_query_duration_milliseconds'
COMPARE WITH 1 week ago
FACET DIGEST_TEXT
SINCE 1 hour ago
```

### **Business Intelligence Patterns**

```nrql
-- Revenue-Critical Query Performance
SELECT average(mysql_query_duration_milliseconds) as 'Avg Latency',
       count(*) as 'Executions',
       percentage(count(*), WHERE mysql_query_duration_milliseconds < 500) as 'SLA Compliance %'
FROM Metric 
WHERE business_category = 'revenue'
  AND metricName = 'mysql_query_duration_milliseconds'
FACET db.sql.table
SINCE 1 hour ago
```

## üé® **Dashboard Customization Guide**

### **Creating Module-Specific Dashboards**

```json
{
  "name": "Module Performance Dashboard",
  "description": "Performance monitoring for specific database intelligence modules",
  "pages": [
    {
      "name": "Module Overview",
      "widgets": [
        {
          "title": "Module Health Status",
          "visualization": "billboard",
          "nrql": "SELECT latest(health_status) FROM Metric WHERE module = '{{module_name}}'"
        },
        {
          "title": "Module Response Time",
          "visualization": "line",
          "nrql": "SELECT average(response_time_ms) FROM Metric WHERE module = '{{module_name}}' TIMESERIES"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Variable Configuration**

Standard dashboard variables:
- `{{environment}}`: production, staging, development
- `{{module_name}}`: core-metrics, sql-intelligence, etc.
- `{{time_range}}`: 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d
- `{{mysql_instance}}`: MySQL server identifier

## üìà **Alerting Integration**

### **Dashboard-Driven Alerts**

Key alerts derived from dashboard metrics:
- **Query Performance SLA Breach**: Response time > 1000ms for business-critical queries
- **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Connection utilization > 90%
- **Wait Event Spike**: Wait time anomalies > 3 standard deviations
- **Resource Saturation**: CPU or memory utilization > 85%

### **Alert Correlation Dashboard**

```nrql
-- Active Alerts by Severity
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName = 'anomaly_alert'
  AND timestamp > (now() - 1 hour)
FACET severity
```

```nrql
-- Alert Resolution Trends
SELECT count(*) as 'Alerts Fired',
       count(*) as 'Alerts Resolved'
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName = 'anomaly_alert'
TIMESERIES 1 hour
SINCE 24 hours ago
```

## üîç **Dashboard Validation & Testing**

### **Automated Dashboard Testing**

```bash
# Test dashboard data availability
./shared/newrelic/scripts/test-dashboard-data.sh

# Validate NRQL query syntax
./shared/newrelic/scripts/validate-nrql.sh --dashboard "executive-dashboard"

# Performance test dashboard loading
./shared/newrelic/scripts/benchmark-dashboard.sh --dashboard-id 12345
```

### **Data Quality Validation**

```nrql
-- Verify Data Completeness
SELECT count(*) as 'Data Points',
       uniqueCount(mysql.endpoint) as 'Unique Instances',
       latest(timestamp) as 'Last Update'
FROM Metric 
WHERE instrumentation.name LIKE 'mysql-%'
SINCE 1 hour ago
```

```nrql
-- Check for Missing Modules
SELECT uniqueCount(module) as 'Active Modules'
FROM Metric 
WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry'
SINCE 5 minutes ago
```

## üìö **Best Practices**

### **Dashboard Design Principles**
1. **Progressive Detail**: Executive ‚Üí Operational ‚Üí Technical drill-down
2. **Context Preservation**: Consistent time ranges and filters across widgets
3. **Performance First**: Optimized NRQL queries for fast loading
4. **Mobile Responsive**: All dashboards work on mobile devices
5. **Self-Documenting**: Clear widget titles and helpful descriptions

### **Query Optimization Guidelines**
- Use `SINCE` clauses to limit time ranges
- Leverage `FACET` for grouping instead of multiple queries
- Use `percentage()` function for SLA calculations
- Apply `LIMIT` to prevent large result sets
- Utilize `COMPARE WITH` for trend analysis

### **Maintenance Schedule**
- **Daily**: Validate data freshness and alert functionality
- **Weekly**: Review dashboard performance and optimize slow queries
- **Monthly**: Update business metrics and KPI definitions
- **Quarterly**: Assess dashboard usage and retire unused dashboards

## üöÄ **Deployment Instructions**
