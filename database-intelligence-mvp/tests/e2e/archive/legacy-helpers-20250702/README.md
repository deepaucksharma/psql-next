# Legacy Helper Files Archive - July 2, 2025

This directory contains legacy Go helper files that provided test utilities and environment setup.

## Archived Files

- `test_helpers.go` - Query patterns and load testing utilities
- `test_setup_helpers.go` - Database setup and configuration helpers
- `test_environment.go` - Environment configuration and management
- `test_data_generator.go` - Test data generation utilities

## Replacement

These files were replaced by:
- `framework/interfaces.go` - Structured interfaces for test components
- `framework/types.go` - Proper type definitions and contracts
- `workloads/` - Dedicated workload generation utilities
- `validators/` - Specialized validation components

## Reason for Archival

These legacy helpers had the following issues:
- Mixed responsibilities and unclear separation of concerns
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Limited extensibility
- No proper interface definitions

The unified framework provides a cleaner, more maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns.
