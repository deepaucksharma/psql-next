# Legacy Log Files Archive - July 2, 2025

This directory contains historical log files from previous E2E test executions.

## Archived Files

Various `.log` files that were generated during legacy test runs, including:
- Test execution logs
- Error logs
- Output logs from different test scenarios

## Current Approach

Log files are now managed through:
- Structured output directories with timestamps (`results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`)
- Proper log rotation and cleanup
- Integration with the unified test framework
- Centralized logging configuration

## Reason for Archival

These legacy log files were:
- Generated by old test runners with inconsistent formats
- Not properly organized or timestamped
- Accumulating without proper cleanup
- Not integrated with the current reporting system

The unified framework now provides proper log management and cleanup procedures.
