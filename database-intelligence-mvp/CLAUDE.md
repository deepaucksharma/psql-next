# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The Database Intelligence Collector is an OpenTelemetry-based monitoring solution with 4 sophisticated custom processors (3,242 lines of production code). It follows an OTEL-first architecture, using standard components where possible and custom processors only to fill gaps.

## Critical Context

### ✅ PRODUCTION FIXES APPLIED (2025-06-29)
The critical issues identified have been resolved:

1. **✅ State Management Fixed**: All processors now use in-memory state only (no Redis dependency)
2. **✅ Single-Instance Deployment**: Removed HA configurations requiring Redis 
3. **✅ Safe Plan Collection**: Plan extractor works with existing data, no unsafe dependencies
4. **✅ Resilient Pipeline**: Processors gracefully handle missing dependencies
5. **✅ Enhanced PII Protection**: Comprehensive sanitization beyond basic regex

### Deployment Model
**RECOMMENDED**: Use `config/collector-resilient.yaml` for production deployments
- ✅ **No Redis dependency** - All state management is in-memory only
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - Uses standard PostgreSQL pg_stat_statements
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - Components work independently
- ✅ **Enhanced PII protection** - Credit cards, SSNs, emails, phones sanitized

### Build System Status
**✅ WORKING**: The basic Go build works successfully with all custom processors enabled.
- All module paths standardized to `github.com/database-intelligence-mvp`
- All 4 custom processors (adaptivesampler, circuitbreaker, planattributeextractor, verification) are built and registered
- OTEL version aligned to v0.128.0 across all configuration files

**⚠️ OCB Compatibility Note**: The OpenTelemetry Collector Builder (v0.129.0) currently has a version compatibility issue with OTEL v0.128.0 components. The basic `go build` works correctly, but `make build` (which uses OCB) may fail due to API changes in the queue.Encoding interface. This is a known upstream issue that will be resolved in future OTEL releases.

### OTLP Exporter Status
**✅ RESOLVED**: Using standard OTLP exporter from OpenTelemetry. No custom OTLP exporter needed.

### Enterprise Features (v2.0.0)
**✅ INTEGRATED**: Enterprise processors for cost control and integration monitoring
- ✅ **Cost Control Processor**: Budget enforcement with intelligent data reduction
- ✅ **NR Error Monitor**: Proactive NrIntegrationError detection
- ✅ **Layered Architecture**: Agent → Gateway → New Relic pipeline
- ✅ **mTLS Security**: Certificate-based internal communication
- ✅ **Enterprise Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and runbooks

- **Processors**: `memory_limiter`, `batch`, `transform`, `resource`
- **Exporters**: `otlp`, `prometheus`, `debug`

## Configuration Modes

### Standard Mode (Works Today)
```yaml
# config/collector-simplified.yaml
receivers: [postgresql, mysql, sqlquery]
processors: [memory_limiter, batch, transform]
exporters: [otlp, prometheus]
```

### Experimental Mode (Requires Build Fix)
```yaml
# Includes custom processors
processors: [memory_limiter, adaptive_sampler, circuit_breaker, 
            plan_extractor, verification, batch]
```

## Testing Custom Processors

```bash
# Test adaptive sampler
go test -v ./processors/adaptivesampler/

# Test with specific rule evaluation
go test -v -run TestRuleEvaluation ./processors/adaptivesampler/

# Test circuit breaker state transitions
go test -v -run TestCircuitBreakerStates ./processors/circuitbreaker/

# Benchmark processing performance
go test -bench=. ./processors/...
```

## Environment Variables

Required for runtime:
- `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
- `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
- `ENVIRONMENT` (production/staging/development)

## Key Documentation

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Validated architecture guide
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` - Working configuration examples
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment blockers and fixes
- `docs/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DEEPDIVE.md` - Detailed code analysis
- `docs/architecture/PROCESSORS.md` - Comprehensive processor documentation
- `docs/ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Enterprise deployment patterns
- `README_ENTERPRISE.md` - Enterprise quick start guide

## Common Issues

1. **Build fails with module not found**
   - Fix module path inconsistencies (see Critical Context above)

2. **OTLP exporter panic with TODO**
   - Remove custom OTLP exporter or complete implementation

3. **Processor not found error**
   - Ensure custom processors are registered in `main.go`
   - Check TypeStr constants are exported

4. **State file permissions**
   - Adaptive sampler needs write access to state file directory
   - Default: `/var/lib/otel/adaptive_sampler.state`

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory**: 256-512MB with all processors
- **CPU**: 10-20% with active processing
- **Startup time**: 3-4s with custom processors
- **Processing latency**: 1-5ms added by custom processors

## Documentation Update Guidelines

When making changes to the codebase, maintain documentation accuracy by following these guidelines:

### 1. Processor Changes
When modifying any custom processor:
- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with new features/capabilities
- Update `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` with new configuration options
- Update line counts in documentation if significant code is added/removed
- Mark features as [DONE], [PARTIALLY DONE], or [NOT DONE]

### 2. Build System Changes
When fixing build issues or changing module structure:
- Update this CLAUDE.md file's "Critical Context" section
- Update `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with new deployment procedures
- Remove warnings once issues are resolved

### 3. Configuration Changes
When adding/modifying configuration options:
- Update `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` with working examples
- Update relevant processor sections in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Ensure all examples are validated against actual implementation

### 4. Performance Changes
When optimizing or changing resource usage:
- Update performance metrics in this file
- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` resource requirements table
- Document any new caching or optimization strategies

### 5. New Features
When adding new processors or major features:
- Create or update relevant sections in `docs/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DEEPDIVE.md`
- Update `docs/UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md` component inventory
- Add to `docs/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md` if it's a significant addition

### Documentation Validation Process

Before completing any feature:
1. **Verify Claims**: Test that all documented features actually work
2. **Update Status**: Mark implementations as [DONE], [PARTIALLY DONE], or [NOT DONE]
3. **Code Examples**: Ensure all code snippets in docs match actual implementation
4. **Configuration**: Test all configuration examples in documentation
5. **Remove Outdated**: Delete or archive documentation for removed features

### Key Documents to Keep Synchronized

1. **Primary References** (always update these):
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Overall system design and components
   - `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` - All configuration options and examples
   - `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Current deployment status and procedures

2. **Comprehensive Guides** (update for major changes):
   - `docs/UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md` - Complete project status
   - `docs/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DEEPDIVE.md` - Detailed implementation
   - `docs/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary

3. **This File** (CLAUDE.md):
   - Update build commands when build system changes
   - Update common issues as new ones are discovered/resolved
   - Keep performance characteristics current

### Example Documentation Update

When fixing the module path issue:
```bash
# After fixing in code, update documentation:
# 1. Remove warning from CLAUDE.md "Critical Context"
# 2. Update docs/DEPLOYMENT.md to show issue as resolved
# 3. Update docs/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md status from "NEAR PRODUCTION READY" to "PRODUCTION READY"
```

Remember: Documentation accuracy is critical. It's better to mark something as [NOT DONE] than to document features that don't exist.

## Development Philosophy & Task Management

### End-to-End Flow Thinking

Before making any changes, always analyze the complete data flow:

1. **Data Collection** (Database → Receiver)
   - How is data queried from PostgreSQL/MySQL?
   - What metrics are collected?
   - Collection intervals and resource impact?

2. **Processing Pipeline** (Receiver → Processors → Exporter)
   - Which processors touch the data?
   - What transformations occur?
   - How do processors interact (order matters)?
   - Performance implications of each step?

3. **Data Export** (Exporter → New Relic)
   - OTLP format requirements
   - Batching and compression settings
   - Error handling and retries
   - New Relic specific attributes needed?

### OTEL Best Practices Checklist

When implementing changes, ensure compliance with OpenTelemetry standards:

- **Resource Detection**: Proper service.name, environment attributes
- **Semantic Conventions**: Use standard attribute names (db.system, db.name, etc.)
- **Context Propagation**: Maintain trace/span relationships
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking failures, graceful degradation
- **Batching**: Efficient use of batch processor
- **Memory Management**: Proper use of memory_limiter
- **Observability**: Expose internal metrics for monitoring

### Task Management Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Always use the TodoWrite tool to manage development tasks. Maintain a minimum of 7 todos at all times to ensure comprehensive planning and tracking.

#### Initial Task Planning
When starting any feature or fix:
```
1. Analyze requirements and impacts
2. Create initial todo list with 7+ items covering:
   - Code changes needed
   - Test updates required
   - Documentation updates
   - Configuration changes
   - Performance validation
   - Integration testing
   - Production readiness checks
```

#### Continuous Task Management
- **Mark todos as in_progress** when starting work
- **Mark as completed** immediately upon finishing
- **Add new todos** as you discover additional work
- **Revisit todo list** after completing each task
- **Maintain minimum 7 todos** by breaking down large tasks

#### Example Todo Structure
```
- Fix module path in go.mod [pending]
- Update import statements in processors [pending]
- Fix ocb-config.yaml module references [pending]
- Test build process after fixes [pending]
- Update CLAUDE.md Critical Context section [pending]
- Update docs/DEPLOYMENT.md with fix confirmation [pending]
- Validate all processor imports [pending]
- Run integration tests [pending]
- Update FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md status [pending]
```

### Change Impact Analysis

Before implementing any change, consider:

1. **Upstream Impact**
   - Will this affect data collection?
   - Database query performance implications?
   - Resource usage on source databases?

2. **Pipeline Impact**
   - Effects on other processors in the chain?
   - Memory/CPU usage changes?
   - Latency additions?

3. **Downstream Impact**
   - New Relic data format compatibility?
   - Metric cardinality changes?
   - Dashboard/alert implications?

4. **Operational Impact**
   - Configuration complexity?
   - Backward compatibility?
   - Migration requirements?

### Example: Adding a New Processor

```bash
# WRONG: Just writing code
❌ Create processor file and start coding

# RIGHT: Full flow analysis with todos
✅ 1. Use TodoWrite to create comprehensive task list:
   - Analyze where in pipeline the processor fits
   - Design processor interface and configuration
   - Implement core processing logic
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Create unit tests with 80%+ coverage
   - Add integration tests
   - Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Update docs/CONFIGURATION.md
   - Add processor to ocb-config.yaml
   - Test end-to-end flow
   - Validate New Relic data appears correctly
   - Update performance characteristics
   - Create troubleshooting guide
```

### Continuous Validation

During development, regularly check:
- `TodoRead` - Review current task status
- `make test` - Ensure nothing breaks
- `make collector-debug` - Test with real data
- Check metrics endpoint for processor health
- Validate data appears correctly in New Relic
