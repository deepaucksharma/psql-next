## Quick Start

### Fastest Path to Running Collector

```bash
# Install Task (build automation tool)
brew install go-task/tap/go-task  # macOS
# or: sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin  # Linux

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/database-intelligence-mvp
cd database-intelligence-mvp

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials and New Relic license key

# Start everything
task quickstart
```

This single command will:
- Install dependencies
- Fix common setup issues  
- Build the collector
- Start PostgreSQL and MySQL containers
- Begin collecting and sending metrics to New Relic

### For Different Audiences

**For Operators**: Start with [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for production deployment options using Docker, Kubernetes/Helm, or binaries.

**For Developers**: Read [TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DEEPDIVE.md](./TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DEEPDIVE.md) for code architecture and [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for debugging.

**For Architects**: Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design and [UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md](./UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md) for comprehensive analysis.

**For Configuration**: See [CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed configuration options and environment overlays.

### Testing the Collector

This project includes a comprehensive testing suite to ensure quality and reliability.

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: For interaction with live databases.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: For validating the entire pipeline against New Relic.

For detailed instructions on how to run these tests, please see the **[Testing Guide](./TESTING.md)**.

## Infrastructure Modernization

### Taskfile Commands
We've replaced 30+ shell scripts with organized Task commands:

```bash
# Core Operations
task build              # Build collector
task test              # Run tests
task run               # Run collector
task quickstart        # Complete setup for new developers

# Development
task dev:up            # Start development environment
task dev:watch         # Hot reload mode
task dev:logs          # View logs
task health-check      # Check collector health

# Deployment  
task deploy:docker     # Docker deployment
task deploy:helm       # Kubernetes deployment
task deploy:binary     # Binary deployment

# Validation & Fixes
task validate:all      # Validate everything
task fix:all          # Fix common issues
task clean            # Clean build artifacts
```

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Overlays**: `base/`, `dev/`, `staging/`, `production/`
- **Environment Files**: `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`
- **Helm Values**: Per-environment values files with GitOps support

## Documentation Standards

All documentation is:
- âœ… Validated against actual implementation
- âœ… Updated with modernized infrastructure (Taskfile, Docker Compose profiles, Helm)
- âœ… Includes working examples and commands
- âœ… Marks features as [DONE], [NOT DONE], or [PARTIALLY DONE]
- âœ… Maintained with CLAUDE.md guidelines for automatic updates
