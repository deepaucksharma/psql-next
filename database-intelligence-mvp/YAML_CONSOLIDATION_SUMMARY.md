## Key Consolidation Strategies

### 1. **Base Template Extraction**
- **Common Patterns**: Extracted receiver, processor, and exporter patterns shared across configurations
- **Composition**: Created reusable components that can be combined for different use cases
- **Environment Variables**: Standardized configuration through environment variable substitution

### 2. **Environment-Based Configuration**
- **Development**: Debug-enabled, high sampling, relaxed security
- **Staging**: Production-like with enhanced logging and moderate sampling  
- **Production**: Optimized performance, security-focused, conservative sampling

### 3. **Docker Compose Profiles**
```yaml
profiles: ["dev", "prod", "ha", "monitoring", "test"]
```
- **Single File**: Replaced 11 Docker Compose files with 1 profile-based configuration
- **Service Variants**: Different service combinations based on deployment needs
- **Resource Scaling**: Environment-appropriate resource limits

### 4. **Test Configuration Simplification**
- **17 → 3 configurations**: Minimal, comprehensive, and performance test configs
- **Parameterization**: Template-based approach with environment variable customization
- **Purpose-Built**: Each config optimized for specific testing scenarios

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Merging Tool
Created `scripts/merge-config.sh` with capabilities:
- **YAML Merging**: Combines base templates with environment overrides
- **Validation**: Syntax and structure validation
- **Generation**: Automated config generation for different environments
- **Docker Compose**: Automatic Docker Compose override generation

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Generate development configuration
./scripts/merge-config.sh development

# Generate and validate production config
./scripts/merge-config.sh production --validate

# Custom output directory
./scripts/merge-config.sh staging --output /tmp/configs
```

## Eliminated Redundancies

### Collector Configurations (23 → 5)
- **collector.yaml** → Merged into base templates
- **collector-simplified.yaml** → Merged into base templates
- **collector-minimal-test.yaml** → Consolidated into test configs
- **collector-gateway-enterprise.yaml** → Environment-specific overlay
- **collector-plan-intelligence.yaml** → Feature flags in base config

### Docker Compose Files (11 → 1)
- **docker-compose.yml** → Profile: dev
- **docker-compose.production.yml** → Profile: prod  
- **docker-compose.ohi-migration.yaml** → Profile: ha
- **deploy/docker/*.yaml** → Merged into consolidated file
- **deploy/examples/*.yaml** → Replaced by profiles

### Test Configurations (17 → 3)
- **tests/e2e/config/*.yaml** → Consolidated into 3 purpose-built configs
- **tests/e2e/testdata/*.yaml** → Parameterized templates
- **tests/e2e/*.yaml** → Simplified test scenarios

## Benefits Achieved

### 🔧 **Maintainability**
